HOW IT BEGAN ~ I started my youtube channel to showcase the birds and wildlife in Cornwall UK. Although the videos were very well received they did not get very many views. I then decided to title a video ""Video for Cats"" and I was shocked and amazed at the feedback and how many views and subscribers I got. I had no idea that people even searched for videos for cats or cat tv etc. I am incredibly grateful to everyone who has watched and subscribed to my channel over the years. Thank you ~ Paul Dinning
