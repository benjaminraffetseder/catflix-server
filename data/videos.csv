TV for cats, dogs, parrots, budgies and all nature lovers. Non-stop streaming of little birds in Winter Wonderland in 4K HDR

Winter TV for cats, dogs, parrots, budgies and all nature lovers. 12 hours of little birds and fluffy red squirrels are here to entertain you. Countless little birds are busy to keep themselves warm during long cold months and short winter days. Squirrels come from the forest for a snack and carry away nuts for safe keeping - for the days, when it's too cold and/or too much snow to leave their comfy dreys. 

Welcome to a world inhabited by:

Eurasian Red Squirrel (Sciurus Vulgaris) 
Great Spotted Woodpecker (Dendrocopos Major) 
Great Tit (Parus Major) 
Eurasian Blue Tit (Cyanistes Caeruleus) 
Common Blackbird (Turdus Merula)

He appears to have been injured a few weeks ago, losing his tail and left foot, and some scaring on his upper body. I'm not sure what happened but I'm so happy to see his injuries have healed. #resilient squirrel 🐿️❤️‍🩹 Making sure to put out extra food in the underbrush so he can hide from predators, if he decides to stick around.

Don't forget to turn on Four Paws TV for your pets while you're away or cuddling on the sofa together.

Cute and active mice playfully climb upstairs, with some little mice jumping along the ladder, eventually realizing it can be used too. These funny moments are sure to delight both viewers and feline friends.

When a mouse darts around in zigzag patterns, it triggers the cat's predatory instincts. Cats are natural hunters, and their ability to focus intensely on moving objects, coupled with their agility, makes them formidable predators. Watching a cat tracking a mouse is like witnessing a primal dance between predator and prey, each relying on their instincts and reflexes. It's a scene that's played out for millennia, yet it never fails to captivate us with its raw, instinctual drama.

At Catflix, we strive to create videos that are not only relaxing for cats and dogs but also enjoyable for humans. So sit back, watch the reactions of your cats, and enjoy the real sounds of mouse activities like running, squeaking, and eating, which add even more enjoyment for your feline companions.

All videos are filmed by us, sometimes taking more than four days for a single video. Background bird chirping sounds are recorded separately with professional mics like the Rode NTG and Zoom H6, plus a wireless mic on the spot to capture real-time sounds of birds and squirrels.

There are pieces of fresh corn, nuts, and fruits laid out at miniature stuff on a red carpet and the air is filled with the delicious aroma of their feast.
curious cats watch with wide eyes and twitching tails. They can't resist the temptation to play a game of hide and seek with the mischievous mice, their whiskers twitching with anticipation as they wait for the perfect moment to pounce.
The mice, however, are clever little creatures, darting and dashing between the nooks and crannies of their cozy hideaway, always staying one step ahead of their feline spectators. They giggle and squeak with glee as they outmaneuver their would-be hunters, their tiny tails wiggling with excitement.
we set all on a red carpet as Cats are often attracted to the color red because it mimics the appearance of small prey, like birds or rodents, which they instinctively hunt. This adds an extra element of excitement for the feline spectators, as they're drawn to the vibrant color, their predatory instincts kicking in as they eagerly track the movements of the tiny creatures scurrying about. It's all part of the playful dance between predator and prey, where even the simplest of details can add to the magic of the moment.
Paul birder always try to make videos that not only relaxing for cat & dogs even human too. so sit back and watch the reaction of your cats. 
real sounds of mouse activities like run, squeaking and eating creates more enjoyments to felines.

Note: All videos are filmed ourselves , some time we spend more than 4 days for a single video , background birds chirping sound is recorded separately with many of professional mic like rode NTG and zoom h6 , plus a wireless mic on the spot to capture real time sound of birds or squirrels,

The stealthy run of a mouse is truly something to behold! Mice are masters of agility and stealth, able to navigate even the smallest of spaces with ease. Their ability to move quietly and swiftly adds to their mystique and makes them a challenging target for predators, including our curious feline friends.
In the cat-and-mouse game, both sides rely on their unique skills—the cat's keen senses and hunting instincts, and the mouse's agility and ability to disappear into the shadows. It's a timeless game of wits and reflexes that never fails to fascinate!
Cats are naturally curious creatures, so seeing their reactions to the animated escapades of their rodent counterparts can be a delight. It's like they're fully immersed in the game, perhaps even strategizing their own techniques for catching mice. It's a playful form of entertainment for both cats and humans alike!
Paul birder always try to make videos that not only relaxing for cat & dogs even human too. so sit back and watch the reaction of your cats.

The videos are also perfect to play while trying to relax or get to sleep.

One Hour of Relaxing Scenes and Sounds of Cornwall - Carnewas and Bedruthan Steps is a stretch of coastline located on the north Cornish coast between Padstow and Newquay, in Cornwall, England, United Kingdom and is part owned by the National Trust. The National Trust maintains a shop and cafe. 

The cliff–top view of rocks stretching into the distance along Bedruthan beach makes the area a popular attraction for tourists and painters.

The property affords walks along the coast path and the steep steps at Bedruthan allow access to a series of rocky beaches at low tide. Signs at the top of the steps down to the beaches warn visitors not to risk swimming in these waters due to heavy rips, fast tides and submerged rocks.
