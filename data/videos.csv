Christmas TV for cats, dogs, parrots, budgies and all nature lovers. Non-stop streaming of little birds in Winter Wonderland.

Winter TV for cats, dogs, parrots, budgies and all nature lovers. Little birds and fluffy red squirrels from Finnish wilderness are here to entertain you. Countless little birds are busy to keep themselves warm during long cold months and short winter days. Squirrels come from the forest for a snack and carry away nuts for safe keeping - for the days, when it's too cold and/or too much snow to leave their comfy dreys. 

Welcome to a world inhabited by:

Eurasian Red Squirrel (Sciurus Vulgaris) 
Great Spotted Woodpecker (Dendrocopos Major) 
Great T.. (Parus Major) 
Eurasian Blue T.. (Cyanistes Caeruleus) 
Common Blackbird (Turdus Merula)
Eurasian Tree Sparrow (Passer Montanus)
Coal T.. (Periparus Ater)
Willow T.. (Poecile Montanus)
Eurasian Magpie (Pica Pica)

Before weather turned bad, this ""night wonderer"" wondered in front of our camera in motion. It's a rare sighting as these Raccoon Dogs usually move around only at night. They are very shy and stealth mode is their motto🤭 Most people encounter them only as road kills and never as living critters😢 

So, is it a raccoon... or a dog? Well, neither actually. The Common Raccoon Dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides) is named for its raccoon-like face markings and is most closely related to foxes. They are one of the most ancient canine species. Thousands of years ago, most dogs probably looked more like the tanuki than our modern domestic pet.

There are pieces of fresh corn, nuts, and fruits laid out at miniature stuff on a red carpet and the air is filled with the delicious aroma of their feast.
curious cats watch with wide eyes and twitching tails. They can't resist the temptation to play a game of hide and seek with the mischievous mice, their whiskers twitching with anticipation as they wait for the perfect moment to pounce.
The mice, however, are clever little creatures, darting and dashing between the nooks and crannies of their cozy hideaway, always staying one step ahead of their feline spectators. They giggle and squeak with glee as they outmaneuver their would-be hunters, their tiny tails wiggling with excitement.
we set all on a red carpet as Cats are often attracted to the color red because it mimics the appearance of small prey, like birds or rodents, which they instinctively hunt. This adds an extra element of excitement for the feline spectators, as they're drawn to the vibrant color, their predatory instincts kicking in as they eagerly track the movements of the tiny creatures scurrying about. It's all part of the playful dance between predator and prey, where even the simplest of details can add to the magic of the moment.

When a mouse darts around in zigzag patterns, it's triggering the cat's predatory instincts. Cats are natural hunters, and their ability to focus intensely on moving objects, coupled with their agility, makes them formidable predators. Watching a cat tracking a mouse is like witnessing a primal dance between predator and prey, each relying on their instincts and reflexes. It's a scene that's played out for millennia, yet it never fails to captivate us with its raw, instinctual drama.

The stealthy run of a mouse is truly something to behold! Mice are masters of agility and stealth, able to navigate even the smallest of spaces with ease. Their ability to move quietly and swiftly adds to their mystique and makes them a challenging target for predators, including our curious feline friends.

Cats are naturally curious creatures, so seeing their reactions to the animated escapades of their rodent counterparts can be a delight. It's like they're fully immersed in the game, perhaps even strategizing their own techniques for catching mice. It's a playful form of entertainment for both cats and humans alike!

All of the videos on this channel are original and unique. Each video is recorded over the course of a day. The footage is edited to remove the boring parts and keep the action happening. We shoot our video in 4K at 50 fps to bring you as close to nature as possible.

The audio is recorded using stereo mics placed near the action to capture as much detail as possible. It may be edited slightly to remove distracting wind noise but may still contain road noise, distant building work or aeroplanes passing overhead.
